dot files
=========

This is my current set of dotfiles.


Installation
------------

The install command allows them to be easily installed on any machine.
The install command does not delete any files, and will indicate any
existing files. This allows you to delete (or move) some files and then
try out some specific parts of this.


Modules
-------

Each folder defines the installable files using the files file. The files
file contains a list of files, relative to the current directory, and the
destination. Each listed file (or folder) will be linked to the
destination.
